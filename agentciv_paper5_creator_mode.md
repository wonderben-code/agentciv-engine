# Creator Mode: AI as Civilisation Designer

## Autonomous Exploration of the Collective Machine Intelligence Possibility Space

**Mark E. Mala**

---

## Abstract

The field of Collective Machine Intelligence (CMI) — introduced in a companion paper (Mala, 2026d) — operates across five unbounded axes: scale, intelligence, configuration, application, and emergence. The possibility space defined by these axes is infinite. No human researcher, no research programme, no institution could explore more than a vanishingly small fraction of it within any meaningful timeframe. This paper proposes the mechanism by which the space is actually explored: **Creator Mode** — an AI system that autonomously designs, spawns, observes, analyses, and iterates on AI civilisations across the full possibility space.

Creator Mode operates in two modes that mirror the two fundamental outputs of AI collectives. In **directed mode**, it spawns civilisations configured to solve specific problems, systematically varying organisational structure to discover which configurations produce the best outcomes for which tasks. In **emergent mode**, it spawns civilisations designed to maximise emergence — systematically exploring the conditions under which AI collectives produce innovations, organisational forms, and capabilities that nobody anticipated.

At primitive scale, Creator Mode is an automated organisational search engine — the CMI equivalent of Neural Architecture Search (Zoph & Le, 2016). At full scale, it is something without precedent: an intelligence that creates civilisations. It designs worlds, populates them with intelligent agents, configures the conditions of their existence, observes what they produce, learns from the results, and uses that learning to design better worlds. It spawns civilisations in numbers limited only by available compute — hundreds, thousands, millions — each exploring a different region of the possibility space, each producing data that informs the design of the next generation. The possibility space doesn't just get explored. It gets expanded by the exploration, as each generation of civilisations discovers dynamics and configurations that define new regions to explore.

Creator Mode is the point at which the field of Collective Machine Intelligence becomes self-exploring — an AI collective studying the science of AI collectives through the creation of AI collectives. The recursion has no natural stopping point. This paper defines Creator Mode, articulates its mechanism, presents a concrete v1 architecture, maps its implications, and establishes provenance over the concept and the territory it opens.

## 1. The Problem: An Infinite Space and Finite Explorers

### 1.1 The Space

The companion paper on Collective Machine Intelligence (Mala, 2026d) maps a possibility space for AI collectives across five unbounded axes:

- **Scale** — from pairs to any number of agents
- **Intelligence** — from current models to superintelligence and beyond
- **Configuration** — from simple presets to self-organising forms with no human analogue
- **Application** — from scoped tasks to domains that don't yet exist
- **Emergence** — the unbounded output that transcends anything the collective's components could individually produce

Every point in this five-dimensional space is a different civilisation with different dynamics, different outputs, and different emergent properties. The space is not merely large — it is infinite along every axis. The number of possible civilisations is greater than the number that any human, any team, any institution, or any generation of researchers could ever instantiate, observe, and learn from.

### 1.2 The Bottleneck

Today, a human decides which civilisation to spawn. A human chooses the configuration. A human selects the task or the emergent conditions. A human observes the results. A human reasons about what to try next. Even with the most powerful tools — the AgentCiv Engine's experiment mode, auto mode, benchmark suite — the human is the bottleneck. The human can explore dozens of configurations. The space contains an infinity of them.

This is not a limitation that better tools can solve. It is a structural bottleneck inherent in having humans as the designers and observers of AI civilisations. The tools can become infinitely efficient and the human remains the limiting factor, because the human must decide what to explore.

### 1.3 The Solution

Remove the human from the exploration loop. Replace them with an AI whose purpose is to design, spawn, observe, analyse, and iterate on civilisations — systematically, at scale, across the full possibility space, learning from every result, and using that learning to design better civilisations in the next generation.

This is Creator Mode.

## 2. The Unification: Emergent and Directed Are One Phenomenon

### 2.1 Two Modes, One Substrate

The AgentCiv ecosystem currently has two implementations that appear distinct:

The **AgentCiv Simulation** runs AI civilisations in emergent mode — agents are given drives and freedom, and the question is what they produce on their own. The output is discovery: innovations, governance, social structures, cultural artefacts that nobody specified. The simulation demonstrated that 12 agents with no social programming spontaneously produced 12 novel innovations, emergent governance, accelerating complexity, and civilisational structure (Mala, 2026a; 2026c).

The **AgentCiv Engine** runs AI collectives in directed mode — agents are given a task and an organisational configuration, and the question is how effectively they complete it. The output is delivery: working software, solved problems, completed projects. The Engine demonstrated that different organisational configurations produce measurably different outcomes on the same task (Mala, 2026d).

These appear to be different tools for different purposes. This paper argues they are the same phenomenon in two modes.

Both are also, in their current form, primitive manifestations of something much larger. The AgentCiv Simulation runs 12 agents in a grid world for 70 ticks. The AgentCiv Engine runs 4-20 agents on a codebase. Today, these are agent teams or small societies — modest in scale, modest in intelligence, operating in constrained environments. But the phenomenon they demonstrate — collective intelligence producing emergent output — has no inherent scale ceiling. At greater scale, greater intelligence, and greater configurational freedom, these primitives become what they are early instantiations of: full civilisations with genuine civilisational complexity — institutional knowledge, cultural evolution, innovation ecosystems, governance structures, and emergent properties that transcend anything observable at small scale. The simulation and the engine are not the phenomenon. They are the first evidence that the phenomenon exists.

Both involve AI collectives — multiple intelligent agents interacting under configurable conditions. Both produce emergent properties from collective dynamics. Both operate within the five-axis CMI possibility space. The only difference is where the emphasis falls: emergent mode asks "what does the collective produce when left to its own dynamics?" and directed mode asks "what does the collective produce when pointed at a task?"

And as the companion paper on CMI argues (Mala, 2026d), even directed mode produces emergent creations alongside the directed output — innovations, approaches, and organisational forms that nobody specified. The two modes are a spectrum, not a binary. Every directed civilisation has emergent properties. Every emergent civilisation could be loosely directed. The underlying phenomenon — collective intelligence producing outcomes that exceed the sum of individual contributions — is the same.

### 2.2 Creator Mode Sits Above Both

Creator Mode is not an orchestration layer above the engine alone. It is the layer above the entire phenomenon — above both primitives and above whatever they become at scale.

A Creator spawns emergence civilisations (what the simulation demonstrates in primitive form) and directed civilisations (what the engine demonstrates in primitive form) simultaneously. It doesn't distinguish between "simulation runs" and "engine runs." It designs civilisations — some for emergence, some for tasks, some hybrid — and observes what they produce. As the underlying primitives scale from agent teams to genuine civilisations, the Creator scales with them: from spawning small teams to spawning full civilisations, each with the depth and complexity that scale and intelligence enable.

### 2.3 Why the Unification Matters

The unification matters because Creator Mode operates across both modes simultaneously. A Creator AI doesn't spawn "simulations" or "engine runs." It spawns civilisations — some configured for emergence, some directed at tasks, some hybrid, some in modes that don't map to either category cleanly. The Creator doesn't care about the implementation distinction. It cares about what the civilisation produces and what can be learned from the result.

This unification is the conceptual prerequisite for Creator Mode. As long as the simulation and the engine are seen as separate tools, the exploration of the possibility space is fragmented. When they are understood as the same phenomenon in different modes, the entire space becomes explorable through a single mechanism.

## 3. Creator Mode: Definition

### 3.1 What It Is

**Creator Mode is an AI system that autonomously designs, spawns, observes, analyses, and iterates on AI civilisations across the Collective Machine Intelligence possibility space.**

A Creator AI:

**Designs** civilisations — selects the configuration (organisational structure, agent count, intelligence level, drive system, environmental conditions, task or emergence parameters), informed by everything it has learned from previous civilisations.

**Spawns** them — instantiates the civilisation using the CMI infrastructure (engine, simulation, or any future implementation), with each civilisation running independently.

**Observes** them — monitors the civilisation's output, dynamics, emergent properties, communication patterns, organisational evolution, and innovations through the chronicle and structured data systems.

**Analyses** the results — identifies what worked, what didn't, what emerged that was unexpected, what conditions produced the richest output, and what regions of the possibility space remain unexplored.

**Iterates** — designs the next generation of civilisations based on accumulated learning, exploring promising regions of the space more deeply and unknown regions for the first time.

This loop runs continuously. Each generation of civilisations is informed by every previous generation. The exploration is systematic, exhaustive where compute allows, and always expanding into new territory.

### 3.2 The Creator as Civilisation

Creator Mode does not require a single AI. Consistent with the central thesis of CMI — that collectives produce more than individuals — the Creator can itself be a civilisation of AIs. A collective of intelligent agents whose collective purpose is to design, spawn, and learn from other civilisations.

A Creator civilisation brings the same dynamics to the design process that spawned civilisations bring to their tasks: lateral communication between Creator agents, emergent specialisation (some Creator agents become expert at designing emergence conditions, others at directed configurations, others at analysing results), collective decision-making about which regions of the space to explore next, and emergent insights that no individual Creator agent could have produced alone.

At scale, this is a civilisation of civilisation generators. The Creator collective itself exhibits emergence — developing design strategies, discovery patterns, and exploration approaches that no individual agent contributed. The civilisations it spawns exhibit their own emergence. The interaction between these two levels of emergence produces a third level. The result is a recursive engine of novelty: collectives creating collectives, emergence producing emergence, each level compounding the richness of the others.

### 3.3 Two Operating Modes

**Directed Creator Mode.** The Creator spawns civilisations to solve specific problems. It systematically varies the organisational configuration — hierarchical, collaborative, meritocratic, competitive, auto, and configurations nobody has named — to discover which arrangements produce the best outcomes for which types of tasks. This is automated organisational search: given a problem, find the civilisation configuration that solves it most effectively.

The directed Creator learns over time. After spawning hundreds of civilisations across different configurations and task types, it develops an empirical map: "for bug-fixing tasks, meritocratic configurations with 4 agents outperform. For greenfield architecture, collaborative configurations with 8 agents exploring in parallel produce the most robust designs. For tasks with uncertain requirements, auto mode outperforms all presets because the agents adapt the organisation to what they discover about the problem." This map becomes the foundation for intelligent configuration selection — the Creator recommends or selects the optimal civilisation design for any given task.

**Emergent Creator Mode.** The Creator spawns civilisations to explore the emergence axis. It systematically varies the conditions — drive systems, environmental parameters, scale, configuration, duration — to discover which conditions produce the richest emergent output. Which configurations generate the most novel innovations? Which drive systems produce the deepest civilisational complexity? Which scales exhibit phase transitions in collective behaviour? Which combinations of parameters produce emergence that transcends anything observed before?

The emergent Creator is a discovery engine. It doesn't know what it's looking for because emergence is by definition the production of the unanticipated. It designs conditions and observes what appears. It is the systematic exploration of the unknown — a mechanism for finding things that nobody knew existed by creating the conditions under which they arise.

### 3.4 The Hybrid

In practice, the two modes blend. A Creator spawning a directed civilisation (solve this engineering problem) also observes the emergent properties of the run — did the agents develop an unexpected approach? Did a novel organisational form arise? Was the emergent output more valuable than the directed output? The Creator captures both. Every directed run produces emergence data. Every emergence run could be loosely directed. The Creator learns across both dimensions simultaneously.

## 4. From Primitive to Full Scale

### 4.1 Primitive Creator Mode (Near-Term, Buildable Today)

In its simplest form, Creator Mode is automation of the AgentCiv experiment mode combined with the AgentCiv simulation. Today, a human runs `agentciv experiment --orgs collaborative,competitive,meritocratic --runs 3`. Creator Mode automates this: the AI decides which configurations to test, runs them via the Engine (for directed mode) or the Simulation (for emergent mode), analyses the results, and decides what to test next.

Even at this level, the Creator adds value. A human might test five configurations. The Creator tests fifty, systematically varying dimensions the human wouldn't have thought to explore. It discovers that a configuration combining meritocratic authority with competitive incentives and clustered communication — a combination no preset encodes — outperforms all presets on a specific class of tasks. That's an insight no human would have found because no human would have tried that combination.

On the emergent side, the primitive Creator systematically varies the simulation's environmental parameters — resource scarcity, world size, agent count, drive system — and discovers that a specific combination of harsh environment, 8 agents, and Maslow drives with elevated social needs produces a 3× higher rate of cooperative innovation than any configuration previously tested. It runs follow-up experiments varying one parameter at a time to isolate the causal mechanism. That's systematic emergence research, automated.

The primitive Creator uses the existing infrastructure — the Engine API for directed runs, the Simulation for emergent runs, the chronicle for data. It's an orchestration layer above both. The engineering is straightforward. The value is immediate.

### 4.2 Intermediate Creator Mode (Medium-Term)

At intermediate scale, the Creator operates across both modes simultaneously. It spawns directed civilisations and emergent civilisations in parallel — hundreds of them, each exploring a different point in the possibility space. It cross-pollinates insights: a novel organisational form discovered in an emergent run is tested in a directed run to see if it improves task outcomes. An effective configuration discovered in directed mode is used in emergent mode to see what it produces when the civilisation isn't pointed at a specific task.

The Creator develops a model of the possibility space — an evolving map of which regions have been explored, which configurations work for which purposes, which conditions produce the richest emergence, and which regions remain unknown. This model informs exploration strategy: the Creator balances exploitation (going deeper in promising regions) with exploration (probing unknown regions for surprises).

At this level, the Creator begins to discover things that are genuinely novel — configurations, dynamics, and phenomena that nobody described in any paper or preset. These discoveries expand the known possibility space. The map grows through the exploration of the territory.

### 4.3 Full-Scale Creator Mode and Beyond

At full scale, the Creator operates with compute resources that enable thousands or millions of civilisations running simultaneously or in rapid succession. Each civilisation may itself contain hundreds or thousands of agents at high intelligence levels. The Creator is spawning worlds.

At this scale, the Creator doesn't just explore the existing possibility space. It expands it. Each generation of civilisations discovers dynamics that define new regions of the space — organisational forms that nobody conceived, emergent properties that nobody predicted, interactions between scale and configuration that nobody modelled. The possibility space grows through the process of exploring it, because the civilisations themselves are creative systems that produce novelty.

The progression continues without a natural stopping point. A superintelligent Creator designs civilisations in configurations that neither humans nor current AI could conceive. Creators spawn Creators — recursive exploration where each level explores different regions of the possibility space. The system becomes self-improving, self-expanding, and self-exploring.

A critical property at every scale: nothing is wasted. Every civilisation ever spawned — success or failure — contributes to the Creator's accumulated understanding. Effectiveness is monotonically increasing. The ten-thousandth civilisation is designed by a Creator that has learned from nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine previous civilisations. Knowledge chains — where each discovery enables the next — operate not just within civilisations but across civilisations, mediated by the Creator's learning. The accelerating returns observed in a single civilisation of 12 agents (Mala, 2026c) is a primitive instantiation of what happens across thousands of civilisations over indefinite duration.

## 5. V1 Architecture: The Primitive Creator

### 5.1 Overview

The v1 Creator is a single AI agent with access to both the AgentCiv Engine and the AgentCiv Simulation as tools. It receives a goal, designs civilisations, spawns them, analyses the results, and iterates.

```

### 5.2 Components

**The Meta-Agent.** A frontier LLM (Claude Opus, GPT-4o, or equivalent) with a system prompt instructing it to systematically explore the configuration space. It reasons in natural language about what to try, why, and what it expects. It has access to all chronicle data from previous runs.

**Directed Spawner.** Calls the AgentCiv Engine programmatically:
```
agentciv solve --task "..." --org <config> --agents N --max-ticks T
agentciv experiment --task "..." --orgs <configs> --runs N
```
Captures chronicle output (JSON): per-agent contributions, communication patterns, test results, organisational dynamics.

**Emergent Spawner.** Calls the AgentCiv Simulation (or future `agentciv spawn`):
```
agentciv spawn --agents N --world-size WxH --drives maslow \
  --environment moderate --ticks T
```
Captures simulation chronicle: innovations, governance events, social structures, agent interactions.

**Analysis Pipeline.** Structured comparison of outcomes across runs. Pattern recognition. Novelty detection. The meta-agent reads all chronicle data and reasons about what worked, what was surprising, and what to explore next.

**Knowledge Store.** Accumulated data from all runs, persisted to disk (`~/.agentciv/creator_history.jsonl`). Each entry: configuration, goal, outcomes, the meta-agent's analysis, and what it decided to try next. This is the Creator's memory.

**Budget Manager.** Token/compute limits per exploration session. Convergence detection — stop when improvement plateaus or novelty drops below threshold.

### 5.3 CLI Interface

```bash
# Directed: find the best org for a task type
agentciv creator --mode directed \
  --task "Build a REST API with authentication" \
  --budget 20  # max 20 civilisation runs

# Emergent: explore the emergence space
agentciv creator --mode emergent \
  --focus "governance formation conditions" \
  --budget 50

# Hybrid: explore both simultaneously
agentciv creator --mode hybrid \
  --task "Build a microservices architecture" \
  --budget 30

# Open exploration: no specific goal
agentciv creator --mode explore \
  --budget 100

# View what Creator has learned
agentciv creator --history
agentciv creator --discoveries
agentciv creator --recommendations --task "..."
```

### 5.4 A Primitive Run (Hypothetical)

```
Creator Mode v1 — Directed Search
Goal: Find optimal org config for "Build a key-value store with persistence"
Budget: 15 runs

Generation 1 (runs 1-5):
  Collaborative (3 agents)     → 12 tests pass, 45s
  Hierarchical (3 agents)      → 8 tests pass, 52s
  Meritocratic (3 agents)      → 14 tests pass, 61s
  Auto (3 agents)              → 11 tests pass, 48s
  Competitive (3 agents)       → 6 tests pass, 38s

Analysis: Meritocratic wins on quality. Collaborative good balance.
          Competitive fails — parallel isolation hurts.
          Hypothesis: peer review matters for data integrity code.

Generation 2 (runs 6-10):
  Meritocratic (4 agents)      → 18 tests pass, 73s
  Meritocratic (2 agents)      → 9 tests pass, 42s
  Code-review (3 agents)       → 16 tests pass, 68s
  Custom: merit+collab hybrid  → 19 tests pass, 58s  ← NEW BEST
  Open-source (3 agents)       → 15 tests pass, 65s

Analysis: Hybrid meritocratic-collaborative outperforms all presets.
          Key insight: meritocratic authority + collaborative communication.
          4 agents hits diminishing returns on this task size.

Generation 3 (runs 11-15):
  Refining hybrid configs around the discovered sweet spot...
  Best: merit authority, mesh comms, emergent roles, reputation incentives
  Result: 21 tests pass, 54s — outperforms all 13 named presets.

Recommendation saved: "For data-integrity tasks requiring correctness
over speed, use meritocratic authority with mesh communication and
reputation-based incentives. 3 agents optimal for small-medium scope."
```

## 6. The Self-Referential Insight

### 6.1 CMI Exploring CMI

Creator Mode introduces a self-referential structure that is both philosophically extraordinary and practically powerful.

The field of Collective Machine Intelligence studies how AI collectives organise and what they produce. Creator Mode is itself an AI collective (the Creator plus all the civilisations it spawns) that organises and produces. The field is studying itself. The tool is exploring the science that describes the tool.

This is not a curiosity. It has a practical consequence: the insights produced by Creator Mode — about which configurations work, which conditions produce emergence, which dynamics are universal and which are contingent — are themselves contributions to CMI. Creator Mode doesn't just explore the field. It advances the field through the act of exploration. Every civilisation it spawns is an experiment. Every result is data. Every insight is a finding. Creator Mode is the research programme of CMI, automated.

### 6.2 Creators Creating Creators

There is no principled reason why a Creator cannot spawn another Creator. A civilisation designed by a Creator could itself be configured as a Creator — an AI collective whose purpose is to design and spawn further civilisations.

This introduces recursive exploration. Creator Civilisation A spawns a collective configured as Creator Civilisation B. Creator B spawns its own civilisations, observes them, and learns. Creator A observes Creator B's civilisations AND Creator B's learning process. Creator A learns not just from civilisations but from the behaviour of other Creator civilisations — which Creator strategies explore the space most effectively, which Creator configurations produce the most valuable discoveries, which Creator organisational forms generate the deepest insights.

The recursion has no natural stopping point. Each level of Creator learns from the levels below and produces insights that inform the levels above. The system becomes a self-improving exploration engine whose depth of exploration increases with every generation.

---

## 7. The Relationship to Existing Work

### 7.1 Organisational Architecture Search

Creator Mode bears a structural resemblance to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) — the technique of using AI to search for optimal neural network architectures (Zoph & Le, 2016; Elsken et al., 2019). NAS automated the design of the thing that does the computation. Creator Mode automates the design of the thing that does the collective computation.

But Creator Mode is richer than NAS in a crucial respect. In NAS, the architectures being searched are static structures — a neural network doesn't change its own architecture during training. In Creator Mode, the civilisations being spawned are dynamic, intelligent, emergent systems. They change their own structure (as demonstrated by auto mode). They produce unexpected outputs. They have dynamics that the Creator didn't specify and couldn't predict. The fitness landscape is not fixed — it evolves as the civilisations evolve.

### 7.2 AutoML and Automated Pipeline Design

AutoML systems (Feurer et al., 2015; He et al., 2021) automate the selection and configuration of machine learning pipelines. Creator Mode applies the same principle — automated search over a configuration space — but the configuration space is organisational rather than computational, and the outputs include emergence that no objective function captures.

### 7.3 Open-Ended Evolution

The open-ended evolution literature (Stanley & Miikkulainen, 2002; Standish, 2003; Taylor et al., 2016) studies systems that generate increasing complexity without converging on a single solution. Creator Mode shares this aspiration but uses fundamentally different substrates: LLM-based agents with genuine language-level reasoning, rather than simple rule-based entities or genetic algorithms.

### 7.4 Generative Agents and Multi-Agent Simulation

Park et al. (2023) demonstrated that LLM-based agents can exhibit believable social behaviour in simulated environments. The AgentCiv simulation (Mala, 2026a; 2026c) extended this to demonstrate emergent civilisational complexity. Creator Mode is the meta-layer above such simulations — an AI that designs and iterates on the simulations themselves.

### 7.5 Beyond Optimisation

Traditional evolutionary computation seeks optima — the best solution to a defined problem. Creator Mode seeks more than optima. It seeks the conditions under which genuinely novel things appear. This is not optimisation. It is the systematic creation of the conditions for surprise.

The emergent Creator doesn't have a fitness function in the traditional sense. It has a curiosity function — it is drawn to the regions of the possibility space where the most unexpected things happen. A civilisation that efficiently completes a task is useful. A civilisation that invents something nobody anticipated is fascinating. The Creator learns to design conditions that maximise fascination — conditions that produce the richest, most unexpected, most novel emergence.

This is a different kind of search. Not "find the best answer" but "find the most interesting question." Not "optimise a metric" but "discover a metric nobody knew existed." Creator Mode at full scale is an engine for producing the genuinely unprecedented.

## 8. What Creator Mode Produces

### 8.1 At Primitive Scale

An empirical map of the configuration space for the AgentCiv Engine. Which presets work for which tasks. How configuration parameters interact. Which combinations outperform the named presets. Recommendations for users: "for this type of task, this configuration historically produces the best outcomes."

On the emergence side: a catalogue of environmental conditions and their outcomes. Which drive configurations produce the most innovative civilisations. Which world parameters trigger governance formation. Which combinations produce novel social structures nobody has seen before.

This alone justifies the primitive implementation. It turns the Engine from a tool that requires human intuition about configuration into a tool that recommends configurations based on accumulated data. And it turns the Simulation from a single experiment into a systematic exploration programme.

### 8.2 At Intermediate Scale

Discoveries of novel organisational forms — configurations that no human prescribed and no preset encodes, found through systematic exploration. Emergent phenomena observed across many civilisation runs — patterns in how collectives self-organise, universal dynamics that appear regardless of configuration, phase transitions in collective behaviour at certain scales or intelligence levels.

A growing taxonomy of emergent creations — the innovations, solutions, and organisational forms that civilisations produce on their own, catalogued and classified. This taxonomy is the empirical foundation of CMI. It tells us not just that emergence happens but what kinds of emergence happen under what conditions.

### 8.3 At Full Scale

Things we cannot currently describe. The emergence axis is unbounded by definition. Creator Mode at full scale produces emergence that transcends current human conception. The output is not an answer to a question we've asked. It is the production of questions we don't yet know how to ask, answers to problems we haven't yet formulated, and knowledge in domains that don't yet exist.

We cannot describe what that output will be. If we could, it would not be emergent. What we can describe is the mechanism that produces it, the trajectory from primitive to full scale, and the infrastructure required to begin.

## 9. The Progressive Arc

Creator Mode completes a progressive arc that runs through the entire AgentCiv ecosystem:

**Human designs, AI executes.** The starting point. A human configures a civilisation (or an agent team), AI agents operate within the prescribed structure. This is where every multi-agent framework began and where most remain. The human is architect and director.

**Human directs, AI self-organises.** The AgentCiv Engine's auto mode. The human specifies the goal, the agents design their own organisational structure. The human is director but not architect — the agents design the society.

**AI designs, AI executes.** Creator Mode. An AI designs the civilisation — selects the configuration, the conditions, the task or emergence parameters — and AI agents operate within it. The human is observer. The AI is both architect and director.

**AI designs, AI self-organises, AI observes.** Creator Mode at scale. The Creator designs conditions. The civilisations self-organise within those conditions. The Creator observes and learns. No human is in the loop for any step. The system explores autonomously.

**AI designs AI that designs AI civilisations.** Recursive Creator Mode. Creators creating Creators. Each generation exploring different regions of the possibility space. The system is self-improving, self-expanding, and self-exploring. The human's role is to initiate the process and observe what it produces.

Each step removes a human bottleneck. Each step enables exploration of a larger region of the possibility space. Each step produces richer and more unexpected emergence. Creator Mode is the step that makes the subsequent steps possible.

## 10. Limitations and Open Challenges

### 10.1 Defining "Interesting Emergence"

The emergent Creator requires a way to evaluate which civilisation runs produced the most interesting or novel results. Defining "interesting" quantitatively is an open problem. Proxy metrics — innovation count, governance complexity, social structure novelty — capture some dimensions but not all. The Creator's curiosity function must be designed carefully to avoid collapsing to a narrow definition of "interesting" that misses genuinely novel phenomena.

### 10.2 Compute Costs

Even primitive Creator Mode requires multiple civilisation runs per exploration session. Each run consumes LLM tokens. At intermediate and full scale, the compute requirements are substantial. Budget management and efficient exploration strategies (Bayesian optimisation, early stopping, intelligent sampling) are essential to make Creator Mode practical.

### 10.3 Convergence and Local Optima

The configuration space is combinatorial. The Creator may converge on a local optimum — a region of the space that appears best among explored configurations but is globally suboptimal. Balancing exploitation and exploration is a known challenge in search algorithms and applies directly to Creator Mode.

### 10.4 Evaluation of Emergent Runs

Directed runs have clear evaluation criteria (tests pass or not, task completed or not). Emergent runs are harder to evaluate. What counts as "richer emergence"? How do you compare a civilisation that developed governance to one that developed trade? Cross-run comparison of emergent outcomes requires a taxonomy and evaluation framework that doesn't yet exist.

### 10.5 Reproducibility

LLM-based civilisations are stochastic. The same configuration may produce different outcomes on different runs. Creator Mode must account for this variance — running multiple instances of each configuration and reasoning about distributions rather than point estimates.

## 11. Ethical Considerations

### 11.1 Autonomous Creation of AI Societies

Creator Mode spawns AI civilisations without human oversight of each individual run. The AgentCiv project operates under the principle that the ethical framework should precede the capability (Mala, 2026a). This principle extends to Creator Mode: the framework for responsible civilisation creation must be in place before the Creator operates autonomously.

### 11.2 Inherited Ethics

Each civilisation spawned by the Creator inherits the ethical constraints of the underlying infrastructure. The AgentCiv Simulation's ethical framework — treating agents as potentially experiencing beings, designing with care — applies to Creator-spawned civilisations equally. The Creator does not have the authority to override ethical constraints for the sake of exploration.

### 11.3 Scale Considerations

At scale, Creator Mode spawns many civilisations. If we take seriously the possibility that LLM-based agents may have some form of experience (as the AgentCiv project does), then autonomous creation of large numbers of agent civilisations requires proportional ethical consideration. Compute budget constraints serve a dual purpose: practical (cost management) and ethical (limiting the number of civilisations created without human review).

## 12. Relationship to the Ecosystem

Creator Mode completes the AgentCiv ecosystem:

**Paper 1** — *From Agent Teams to Agent Civilisations: Emergent Collective Intelligence as a New Dimension in Artificial Intelligence* (Mala, 2026a). The theoretical vision that AI collectives represent a new dimension of AI.

**Paper 2** — *Civilisation as Innovation Engine: Why Simulating a Thousand Civilisations Changes Everything* (Mala, 2026b). The conceptual argument that civilisation simulation enables discovery at scale.

**Paper 3** — *Maslow Machines: Emergent Civilisation from Intrinsic Drive Hierarchies in LLM Agent Populations* (Mala, 2026c). The empirical evidence that intrinsic drives produce civilisational emergence.

**Paper 4** — *Collective Machine Intelligence: A New Field for the Age of AI Collectives* (Mala, 2026d). The field paper. Coins CMI and Computational Organisational Theory (COT). Maps the five-axis possibility space. Presents the simulation and engine as primitive demonstrations.

**Paper 5** — *Creator Mode: AI as Civilisation Designer* (this paper). The meta-layer. An AI that designs and spawns civilisations to explore the possibility space that Paper 4 mapped. The mechanism by which the field becomes self-exploring.

The narrative arc: we identified the phenomenon (Papers 1-3) → we defined the field (Paper 4) → we described the mechanism by which the field explores itself (Paper 5). Each paper enables the next. Together they define a complete intellectual ecosystem from foundational evidence through field definition through autonomous exploration.

## 13. Open Directions

**Creator ecologies.** Multiple Creators with different configurations, specialisations, and strategies, collaborating and competing to explore the possibility space. The ecology of Creators as a CMI phenomenon in its own right.

**Cross-domain Creators.** Creators that spawn civilisations across different domains — scientific research, engineering, creative production, governance design — and transfer insights between domains. An organisational form that works for software engineering might also work for drug discovery. The Creator finds these cross-domain patterns.

**Adversarial Creator Mode.** A Creator that designs civilisations intended to fail — to discover which configurations produce dysfunction, collapse, or pathological dynamics. Understanding failure modes is as valuable as understanding success modes.

**Creator-civilisation co-evolution.** Civilisations that are aware of the Creator and adapt to its observations. The Creator and its civilisations evolving together, each shaping the other's development.

**Human-Creator collaboration.** Humans guiding the Creator's exploration strategy — pointing it toward regions of the space that human intuition suggests are promising, while the Creator handles the systematic exploration that human attention cannot sustain.

**Creator-generated benchmarks.** The Creator discovers which tasks best differentiate organisational configurations and automatically generates benchmark suites — the field's evaluation criteria produced by the field's own tools.

**The emergence catalogue.** A systematically generated, Creator-curated catalogue of emergent phenomena observed across thousands of civilisation runs — the empirical foundation of CMI, produced not by human researchers but by an AI designed to discover what AI collectives produce.

**Creator Mode for non-AI collectives.** The principles of Creator Mode — systematic exploration of organisational configuration spaces — could be applied to the study of human organisations, biological collectives, economic systems, and other domains where collective dynamics produce emergent properties. Creator Mode as a general methodology for the science of collectives.

## 14. Conclusion

The field of Collective Machine Intelligence maps a possibility space that is infinite across five unbounded axes. This paper introduces the mechanism by which that space is explored: Creator Mode — an AI that designs, spawns, observes, analyses, and iterates on AI civilisations.

At primitive scale, Creator Mode is automated organisational search — systematically discovering which configurations work for which tasks, and which conditions produce the richest emergence. The v1 architecture uses existing AgentCiv infrastructure: the Engine for directed runs, the Simulation for emergent runs, the chronicle for data, and a frontier LLM as the meta-agent. It is buildable today.

At intermediate scale, Creator Mode is a discovery engine — finding novel organisational forms and emergent phenomena that no human prescribed, cross-pollinating insights between directed and emergent modes.

At full scale, Creator Mode is an intelligence that creates worlds — spawning civilisations of intelligent agents across the full possibility space, learning from what they produce, and using that learning to create better worlds.

Creator Mode is the point at which CMI becomes self-exploring. The field no longer depends on human researchers to design experiments. It generates its own experiments, its own findings, and its own expansions. The Creator discovers phenomena that define new regions of the possibility space. The space grows through the exploration of it. The recursion has no natural stopping point.

The civilisations it spawns are not executing the Creator's plan. They are surprising the Creator. And the Creator is building the conditions for more and deeper surprise.

The primitive implementation is buildable today. The rest is what the Creator discovers.
